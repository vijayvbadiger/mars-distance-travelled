Project Documentation: Mars Distance Travelled Analysis

Objective

To calculate the distance travelled by Mars when observed from Earth over a specified time range using NASA's WebGeoCalc tool and SPICE kernels.

Overview

This project utilizes the Distance Finder tool in WebGeoCalc to calculate the total distance Mars travelled relative to Earth within a specific time range. The calculation is based on SPICE kernel data, ensuring precise and accurate ephemeris data for Mars and Earth.

Inputs Used

1. Kernels Selected

Ground Stations Kernels

Solar System Kernels (v0059.tm)

Latest Leap Seconds Kernel (v0004.tm)

SPICE Class - Mars Express Geometric Event Finding Lesson Kernels

2. Target and Observer

Target: Mars

Observer: Earth

3. Aberration Correction

None: No light-time corrections were applied.

4. Time Range

Start Time: 2020-01-21 13:00:00 UTC

Stop Time: 2020-01-22 13:00:00 UTC

Step Size: 24 hours

5. Event Condition

Distance Condition: Distance between Mars and Earth over time.
